User Stories

As a user of the hotel system...
I can access the list of all of the rooms in the hotel
I access the list of reservations for a specified room and a given date range
I can access the list of reservations for a specific date, so that I can track reservations by date
I can get the total cost for a given reservation
I want exception raised when an invalid date range is provided, so that I can't make a reservation for an invalid date range



what if there are no reservations?
  - return array of all the rooms
do reservations that don't overlap that don't overlap
