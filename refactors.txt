1. Add Date class. Extract date validations from the various methods and do all this work in a Date class.
  Single Responsibility Principle. 
  Then call the date validation methods in other methods where date validation is needed. 
  Do dates overlap? Are dates valid? 

2. Delete Room class. 
  Rather than have a Room object in Reservation, have room attributs in Reservation. 
  Reservation can know a room's room number and cost and have the methods of res-duration
  and total cost. 

3. Refactor tests using 'Before' and 'Let' accordingly. 

4. Instances are an instance of a class. A class is a collection of methods
  that allows me to create objects that behave in the same way.

5. Consider class methods (self) vs instance methods. Where is it appropriate to use class methods? 

6. Complete Wave 3.
