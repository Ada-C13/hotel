1. Add Date class. Extract date validations from the various methods and do all this work in a Date class.
  Then call the date validation methods in other methods where date validation is needed. 

2. Delete Room class. 
  Rather than have a Room object in Reservation, have room attributs in Reservation. 
  Reservation can know a room's room number and cost and have the methods of res-duration
  and total cost. 

3. Refactor tests using 'Before' and 'Let' accordingly.
