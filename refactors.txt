- Structure
  - think about holding array of Reservations in HotelManager instead of array of Rooms Would need to rewrite methods but this would probably reduce amount of loops being used

- HotelManager
  - move line 77 into a find_reservations method
  - line 28 reserve_room: move room picker into its own method
  - line 56 - add_block_rooms method name is not clear. Rename this to say what this method does (add block reservations to rooms)
  - see if these can be moved into HotelBlock class
    - add_block_room
    - check_block_availability
    - reserve_block_room
  - list_reservations_by_room & list_reservations_by_date have a similar loop: look into making this into a reusable method
    - and/or, look into combining these methods (list_reservations)room = nil, date_range = nil, date = nil)

- HotelBlock
  - store reservations instead of rooms to reduce layers
    - can get rid of find_reservations method by doing this

- Reservation
  - Room also holds cost - remove cost & keep only total_cost in Reservation
    - Change @room_number to @room and hold instance of room
  - move nights to DateRange and call from there

- DateRange
  - hold nights in DateRange and remove from Reservation, and call from DateRange

- Room
  - remove reservations from Room if moved into HotelManager
    - check_availability would need to be moved into HotelManager as well
