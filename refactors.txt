date: Mar 7, 2020 Notes on Hotel project

- DateRage class, instead of passing in an array as date input, 
it can be changed to taking in a Date class instead.
- reservation cost method is currently in front desk, 
maybe this should be calculated in reservation instead.
- currently the reservation id is generated randomly between 1000 to 9999,
it will still have possiblitly of duplicates. 
- the Hotel_bookings csv is restoring all the data every time the program runs,
maybe this should be changed to appending new reservations instead. 
- hotel block is in front desk, maybe this should be its own class.
