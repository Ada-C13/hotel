My program has 5 classes: room, date range, reservation, hotel block and front desk.
most of what user needs to get/do is done at front desk, except cost that is calculated in reservation.
non of the classes are parent or child to another (no class inheritance) but classes are relate as below:
1- reservation has a date range and a room.
2- hotel block also has date range and a bunch of rooms.
3- reservation is consisted of a room a date range and whether or not it belongs to a block.
4- front desk works with all other classes.

If I wanted to refactor 
1- I would have start date and end date arguments for some methods instead of date range.
2- I would create a database for collected data. (perhaps a CSV file)
3- I might have made a helper method to find reservations overlapping with a date range (not just one date)
