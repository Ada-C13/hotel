To refactor:
- I think some of my methods are too complicated and too much dependency within methods. 
  I would love to spend some time to clean that up
- try to follow the single responsibility 
- Dry it up!
- would like to add more stuff in each class so it would be small methods 
- maybe I should have a room class?
