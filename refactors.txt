A few things to change moving forward:

Tighter code
  1. Refactor code with Enumerable methods where possible
  2. Consider where ternary format could be used
  3. Reconsider where other helper methods could be created

Block class
  1. Consider pulling out a separate Block class and using Reservation as it's super class -- that way, if you used super in intitialize, you'd only have to add on block: and block_key:

DateRange class
  1. Reconsider DateRange as it's own class (has no independent behaviors)

Tighten up variable naming conventions
  1. Make sure method naming conventions follow a pattern
  2. Make sure method naming conventions logically build on one another IE reserve_from_block relies on update_block
  3. Review and update variable names for clarity and replication
