1. Consider adding Block Class instead of hash structure in ReservationDesk
- ReservationDesk will have a blocks array of Block objects.
- ReservationDesk will have find_block_by_id method.
- Block object will have block_id, rooms (array of Room objects), date_range variables.
- Block object will have reserve_from_block and check_room_availability methods which will be called from inside current ReservationDesk methods.

2. Add date input validation.

3. Add defaults for start and end dates.
(gives functionality to select all reservations from/until specific date)

4. Find a more efficient way to compare dates.
(sort and compare years/months first?..)

5. Consider moving away from having start and end_date as arguments towards using date_range.

6. Implement "no rooms given" scenario for make_block.
