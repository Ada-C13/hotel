Refactoring Hotel:
- go through and be consistent about passing either a daterange or start/end dates

- update tests to reflect this

- refactor so that FrontDesk holds a collection of @rooms, @reservations, & @blocks rather than rooms holding their reservations

- make a choice about rooms; do you want them to be stored as objects or just numbers?

- go through and choose a convention using .first or [0] 

- go through and try to be consistent about the order in which arguments are passed
