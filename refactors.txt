Changes I could make:
1. Gem Money for all costs and prices
2. Make some methods private
3. Better methods names
4. Make price per night in Reservation class constant and/or
5. Make Cost_per_night in Reservation class, similar to Hotel Block
6. Consider removing Room class
7. Change rooms attribute for Reservation class as there can be only 1 room for 1 Reservation
