Things to consider refactoring:
1- Using "before" and "let" in tests.
2- Many of my test are doubled. I often tryed to hit somethings multiple times/ways because I was having trouble in various areas.
   These tests were kept even though they are not needed. 
3- I have a reserve_room method and a res_with_valid_dates method. Part of me thinks I should refactor these into one.
4- The scaffolding had two methods in the DateRange class (overlap? and include?) that I did not use. I still don't think I need them since I fulfilled
   their function somewhere else, but since I don't know what the next project will be I just want to remind future Chelsea  that
   they were there. In fact I made and tested overlap? but commented them out to save them.
5- There is probably more items/functions to move from Hotel Controller to Block but currently I am not 100% sure. Future/smarter Chelsea can figure that out.
